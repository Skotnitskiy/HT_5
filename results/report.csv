Most of them are in the middle, 25% at the bottom, and 25% at the top. You only want the top 5%. Hint: look at returns.<p>2. Investors look at the same decks and do the same number crunching. The ones that consistently choose the right companies have something that the other VCs do not.<p>3. The VCs that are good understand companies in a way that is beyond metrics. They are intuitive. You don’t want a VC that is obsessing over numbers. You want a VC that sees beyond and trusts themselves enough to take risk.<p>4. There are great partners at VC firms, but, ultimately, they have to serve that VC firm. Make sure the culture of that VC firm is a good one. That culture will impact that partner and that partner will impact you.<p>5. VCs don’t like to admit that they are primarily money people. The fancy offices, coffee, etc. is all about putting in small money and later getting out big money. Don’t kid yourself into thinking it is more than that.<p>6. VCs will say anything to get into your company if it is hot. They can be like a high school kid trying to get laid. If they think they can get you, then they’ll say whatever they need to say. They just want to get laid...sorry paid.<p>7. Being a VC is not glamorous. Most of them are unfortunately not happy. It is competitive. They compare themselves a lot. Look at the life they live. Do you want that kind of life?<p>8. Most VCs are not terribly insightful (see #1) and all VCs will make poor judgement calls. The best ones own up to it. The lousy ones deny their mistakes.<p>9. VC&#x27;s control the company. Even the very smart people that have “hacked” the SV system still serve investors. You have to keep them happy. If you have to keep them happy, then you are not in control.<p>10. The best VCs are conflicted about VC. They know how it can crush a founder or company. This bothers them, but they deny it and keep rolling forward."

I am currently 22 years old, studying Computer Science. I&#x27;ve been focusing on web development for almost ten years. I&#x27;ve built up a freelance business with active clients and also tried to work as a Front-end developer for a year in small digital agency.<p>After years I am not satisfied with web development and it doesn&#x27;t make me happy. I can see really young, inexperienced people going into this business, things are changing really fast and there&#x27;s no methodology, no &quot;scientific&quot; way to do it. I can say that web development is somehow punk business with many &quot;script kids&quot; involved.<p>The second thing I don&#x27;t like about the job is lack of social contact. You spend big amount of time in front of a computer and when you want to be the best you have to spend even your free time alone. When you look at those best developers, they look kind of awkward, they don&#x27;t have communication skills and I feel like this is not the way I want to go.<p>Also the third thing that bothers me is the fact that developers are becoming new blue-collar workes (see https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.wired.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;02&#x2F;programming-is-the-new-blue-collar-job&#x2F;) since it&#x27;s kind of easy to learn how to code. You also don&#x27;t need any certification or license. I see that many IT students do have this blue-collar mentality. They dress badly, they swear alot, simply they look like people from lower social classes. This is what bothers me. When I was younger I really appriciated this &quot;punk&quot; side of the IT. Now I hate it.<p>What I am thinkin about is career change to medicine. I am interested in human body and would enjoy studying it. Also medicine as a field seems to be more mature and traditional.<p>Do some of you see it similarly or do you have different opinion? What do you think about it?"

We have traditionally done &quot;time and materials&quot; contracts where the customer gets an estimate for the project, then pays an hourly rate for the initial development and any future support.<p>This has worked OK, but often people will want &quot;sweat equity&quot; contracts.
